          <section>
            <p>
              I began volunteering with the World Health Organization COVID-19 App project in March
              2020. The team started a series of exploratory teams, along with a major effort that
              the majority of developers focused on. I lead an exploratory development in
              Flutter. After 2 days, it was clear that the app I created was the
              more developed than the main effort. We switched the main effort
              to it, and I was promoted to a mobile code owner and a Client UI
              lead.

              Over the next few months I continued to do technical development.
              I wrote over 10,000 lines of code. In mid-August, as the app prepared to launch in Nigeria, I was promoted to
              an overall technical lead, and an overall code owner.

              contributing to our media packets and reaching out to government
              agencies. I have had meetings with Ted Lieu's office, and the
              Nigeria CDC and participate in weekly meetings with the WHO.

            Yale Open Lab was the first international project I was a part of.

          <p>HackSC is USC's largest hackathon, and one of the worlds largest collegiate level hackathons. When I went in 2020, it was my first hackathon. My friend Jason and I built an app, but when the judges came to judge us it didn't work. This year we came back and won. In a weekend we built a full stack marketplace with advanced animations, server security and network acceleration.

          <h4>Hunter Spinks - World Health Organization Technical Lead</h4>
          <p>
            I had the pleasure of working with Ben on an all-volunteer project building the World Health Organization’s consumer-facing mobile app responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. I served as co-lead of the engineering effort, and Ben was one of the star engineers who was one of the most valuable contributors to the code base and the project overall. Ben was an absolute joy to work with, bringing a strong technical skill set, experience in Flutter, a constant positive attitude, a voracious appetite for learning, and a strong work ethic to the team.

Ben proved his value very early on in the project, when we ran parallel efforts to develop the first version of the application in a week’s time using a couple of different mobile frameworks. Though the primary effort ran in Ionic React, Ben led an auxiliary effort to develop the same application in Flutter, coordinating with two other developers. As the deadline approached, Ben’s effort with Flutter proved to be much more polished than that of the other frameworks, and so it was his version of the application that we submitted for our first App Store approvals.

It was an incredible feat to build a launch-ready application for a global organization responding to a worldwide health crisis in just a few days; even more incredible to do so as a high school student! But that’s Ben: never intimidated, meeting every challenge with enthusiasm. Even as the project endured chaotic ups and downs, Ben never complained, only asking what more he could do to help and showing initiative in finding new ways to contribute. We leaned heavily on Ben, who continued to step up throughout the project, serving as the co-lead of the client UI.

Outside of his development contributions, I enjoyed seeing how Ben interacted with other team members, too. On a team that had hundreds of worldwide volunteer engineers constantly flitting in and out of the project, Ben emerged as a positive, empathetic, and patient leader. He went out of his way to help teach the Flutter framework to those with less experience in it. He inspired others with his dedication to the project, as one of the handful of consistent contributors for the entire 6 months I was involved in the project, and when he spoke, the team listened.

To say that Ben has an incredibly bright future ahead of him would be a massive understatement and would discount how much he has to offer right now - we would not have been able to launch the app without him. I’m extremely proud of Ben and impressed by him, and I can’t wait to see what he’s able to accomplish in his career.

            When I first met Ben, I was impressed with technical acumen and his impressive experience building apps that had real world users. He both learns extremely fast, and is interested and able to slow down enough to explain it to the rest of us.

There is no doubt that Ben could be off coding in basement someplace building the next Twitter. But his strong sense of community and team work, makes him uniquely qualified to run multi disciplinary teams and shepherd software projects to their successful completion.

Detail about my experience working with Ben:

Ben soft interviewed all my organizations leaders, identifying the most likely sponsor (which turned out to be me), and then pitched the project’s original concept. He then kept championing the New Schools Today project through the development of the concept until it was time to recruit (many projects don’t make it to that point).

Ben began his recruiting outside the organization (most teams get to use the organizations recruitment pipeline, but Ben’s target team members were not part of that pipeline). This kicked off a cycle of continuous integration: onboarding new team members weekly, and getting the existing team started on productive work - although all the needed roles had not yet been filled.

Ben's team has had almost 100% retention, and continues to grow. They are continuing to identify areas where they need expertise and are expanding their recruitment to gather that expertise. Ben has developed a product roadmap and through his observant and deliberate project leadership, the team has entered the Performing stage of Agile teams.

I am very proud of Hack for LA / Code for America’s first all High School Team and I believe Ben’s team, project and product that they are building will change school environments measurably.
